    <p class="lead">1. General Statements On Terms and Additional 

      Terms
      Welcome to the TheMiddleMan site! These Terms 
      
      of Use (hereinafter, these “Terms”) are a 
      
      legally binding contract between 
      
      TheMiddleMan, LLC or its applicable affiliate 
      
      that owns or controls the applicable Website 
      
      or provides the applicable Services that you 
      
      may be accessing or using (“TheMiddleMan”, 
      
      “us”, “we” or “our”), on the one hand, and 
      
      you and your successors and heirs and (if 
      
      applicable) the corporate entity you 
      
      represent (“you” or “your”), on the other 
      
      hand. Your acceptance of these Terms is an 
      
      express condition of, and governs your access 
      
      to and use of, TheMiddleMan’ (a) websites, 
      
      portals, mobile applications, channels, and 
      
      software, including themiddleman.com, and (b) 
      
      social media pages and channels 
      
      (collectively, the “Websites”), including any 
      
      services, features, media, functions, 
      
      content, tools and links contained or offered 
      
      therein (collectively, the “Services”). If 
      
      you do not accept and agree to these Terms, 
      
      you may not access or use any of the Websites 
      
      or Services or create an account or user 
      
      profile.
      
      Certain areas of the Websites and Services 
      
      (and your access to or use therein) may have 
      
      different terms, conditions, policies, rules, 
      
      and guidelines, which govern your access to 
      
      and use of such Websites and Services (as 
      
      applicable, the “Additional Terms”). The 
      
      Additional Terms will be posted (via a link) 
      
      on the applicable Website or Services and may 
      
      be modified from time to time. To the extent 
      
      there is a conflict between these Terms and 
      
      any Additional Terms for a specific Website 
      
      or Service, the applicable Additional Terms 
      
      shall govern and take precedence over these 
      
      Terms with respect to your use of or access 
      
      to that Website or Service.<br></br>
      
      2. Privacy Statement
      By accessing or using the Websites or 
      
      Services, you agree that the TheMiddleMan 
      
      Privacy Policy (which may be updated from 
      
      time to time) governs TheMiddleMan’ 
      
      collection and use of your personal 
      
      information. Registration data and certain 
      
      other information about you is subject to our 
      
      Privacy Policy. For more information, please 
      
      make sure that you review our Privacy Policy. 
      
      You understand that through your access or 
      
      use of the Websites and any Services, you 
      
      consent to the collection and use (as set 
      
      forth in the Privacy Policy) of this 
      
      information, including the transfer of 
      
      information to the United States and/or other 
      
      countries for storage, processing and use by 
      
      TheMiddleMan. <br></br>
      
      3. Changes to the Terms, Additional Terms, 
      
      and Privacy Statement
      We may make changes to these Terms, the 
      
      Additional Terms, or our Privacy Policy from 
      
      time to time. When we make material changes 
      
      to these Terms, we will notify you by (i) 
      
      sending you an e-mail communication to the 
      
      e-mail address you most recently provided to 
      
      us, (ii) sending a push notification or in-
      
      app notification, (iii) by prominently 
      
      posting a notice of the changes on the 
      
      Websites, or (iv) by requiring you to check a 
      
      box indicating your assent to the updated 
      
      terms. Continued use of any of the Websites 
      
      or Services following any applicable notice 
      
      of such material changes shall indicate your 
      
      acknowledgement of such changes and agreement 
      
      to be bound by the terms and conditions of 
      
      such changes. <br></br>
      
      4. Eligibility
      The Websites and Services are intended solely 
      
      and only available to individuals who are at 
      
      least eighteen (18) years of age, who can 
      
      willingly and knowingly enter into legally 
      
      binding contracts under applicable law. 
      
      Please note that certain of the Websites and 
      
      Services require you to be at least twenty-
      
      one (21) years of age to access and use such 
      
      Websites and Services. Please check the 
      
      applicable Additional Terms for such Websites 
      
      and Services for further information. You may 
      
      be asked to verify that you are over the 
      
      applicable age limit during your use of the 
      
      Websites or Services and you hereby agree 
      
      that you shall not misrepresent your age. 
      
      Without limiting the foregoing, the Websites 
      
      and Services are not available to minors or 
      
      suspended members or users. You further 
      
      represent that any party you invite to 
      
      participate in any of the Services or related 
      
      functions with you is also of legal age as 
      
      described above.
      
      If you are using the Websites or Services on 
      
      behalf of a business, you represent that you 
      
      have the authority to bind the business to 
      
      these Terms, the Additional Terms, the 
      
      Privacy Policy, and any other related or 
      
      pertinent agreements. The applicable business 
      
      agrees to hold harmless and indemnify 
      
      Weedmaps and its affiliates, officers, 
      
      agents, and employees from any claim, suit or 
      
      action arising from or related to the use of 
      
      the Websites or Services or violation of 
      
      these terms, including any liability or 
      
      expense arising from claims, losses, damages, 
      
      suits, judgments, litigation costs, and 
      
      attorneys’ fees. If you do not have such 
      
      authority, you will be held individually 
      
      liable for all actions taken under your user 
      
      ID. <br></br>
      
      5. Electronic Communications
      By accessing or using the Websites or 
      
      Services, you consent to receiving certain 
      
      communications from us electronically. We 
      
      will communicate with you in a variety of 
      
      ways, including, without limitation, by e-
      
      mail, text, in-app push notices, or by 
      
      posting notices and messages on the Websites 
      
      or through any of the Services. By accessing 
      
      or using the Websites or Services, you 
      
      willingly and knowingly agree that all 
      
      contracts, notices, disclosures, agreements, 
      
      and other communications that we provide to 
      
      you electronically satisfy any legal 
      
      requirement that such communications be in 
      
      writing. <br></br>
      
      6. Using The Services
      User Registration and Accounts
      In order to access or use some of the 
      
      Websites or Services, you must first register 
      
      and create an individual profile for yourself 
      
      or a business for such Website or Service 
      
      (each a "User Profile").
      
      By creating a User Profile, you agree that:
      You will not register a username (or email 
      
      address) that (a) is already being used by 
      
      someone else; (b) may impersonate another 
      
      person: (c) belongs to another person; (d) 
      
      violates the intellectual property or other 
      
      right of any person or entity; or (d) is 
      
      offensive. We may reject the use of any 
      
      password, username, or email address for any 
      
      reason in our sole discretion;
      You will provide true, accurate, current, and 
      
      complete registration information about 
      
      yourself in connection with the registration 
      
      process and, as permitted, to maintain and 
      
      update it continuously and promptly to keep 
      
      it accurate, current, and complete. If you 
      
      provide any information that is untrue, 
      
      inaccurate, outdated, or incomplete, Weedmaps 
      
      may suspend or terminate your account and 
      
      refuse you any and all current or future 
      
      access to or use of the Websites and Services 
      
      (or any portion thereof). If you fail to 
      
      update your information in a timely manner, 
      
      then TheMiddleMan has reasonable grounds to 
      
      suspect that such information is untrue, 
      
      inaccurate, outdated or incomplete, which 
      
      will allow TheMiddleMan to suspend or 
      
      terminate your account and refuse you any and 
      
      all current or future access or use of the 
      
      Websites and Services (or any portion 
      
      thereof).
      You will not post libelous content or create 
      
      false or misleading reviews or posts;
      You are solely responsible for all activities 
      
      that occur under your account, password, and 
      
      username—whether or not you authorized the 
      
      activity;
      You are solely responsible for maintaining 
      
      the confidentiality of your password and the 
      
      other Protected Information (as defined 
      
      below) and for restricting access to your 
      
      account so that others may not access any 
      
      password-protected portion of the Websites or 
      
      Services using your Protected Information;
      You will immediately notify us of any 
      
      unauthorized use of your Protected 
      
      Information, or any other breach of security;
      You will not sell, transfer, assign, or 
      
      provide a copy of, your account, account 
      
      rights, user ID, password, API keys, menu 
      
      embed code, or other credentials or access 
      
      rights (the “Protected Information”) for any 
      
      of the Websites or Services to any other 
      
      person or entity. You must keep all of the 
      
      Protected Information in strict confidence;
      You will not share or allow any third party 
      
      to utilize your account on your behalf or on 
      
      a time share basis;
      You will not create more than one account 
      
      unless specifically authorized to do so; and
      You will not use Protected Information of 
      
      others.
      TheMiddleMan is not liable for any loss or 
      
      damage (of any kind and under any legal 
      
      theory) to you or any third party arising 
      
      from your inability or failure for any reason 
      
      to comply with any of the foregoing 
      
      obligations.
      
      If any information that you provide, or if we 
      
      have reasonable grounds to suspect that any 
      
      information that you provide, is false, 
      
      inaccurate, outdated, offensive, incomplete, 
      
      or violates these Terms, any Additional 
      
      Terms, the Privacy Policy, or any applicable 
      
      law, then we may suspend or terminate your 
      
      account, User Profile, and access to and use 
      
      of the Websites and Services at our sole 
      
      discretion and without advance notice or 
      
      liability.
      
      Your User Profile cannot be used to conduct 
      
      commercial activities, including, but not 
      
      limited to, transactions, advertising, 
      
      fundraising, contests, or other promotions 
      
      absent our prior written consent. The menu 
      
      embed feature we provide to clients may only 
      
      be used on a client’s own website or 
      
      application, and the applicable code may not 
      
      be altered in any manner (including by 
      
      removing any TheMiddleMan branding). We may 
      
      offer you the ability to set preferences 
      
      relating to your User Profile, but changes to 
      
      your settings may not become effective 
      
      immediately or be error free, and options may 
      
      change from time-to-time. TheMiddleMan 
      
      assumes no responsibility or liability for 
      
      any issues, problems, or Content on your User 
      
      Profile.
      
      User Profiles may only be set up by an 
      
      authorized representative of the individual 
      
      or business that is the subject of the User 
      
      Profile. TheMiddleMan does not review each 
      
      User Profile to determine if it was created 
      
      by an appropriate party. In addition, 
      
      TheMiddleMan is not responsible for any 
      
      unauthorized User Profiles that may appear on 
      
      the Services. If you believe that a User 
      
      Profile listed on one of the Websites is 
      
      unauthorized, fake, fraudulent, or otherwise 
      
      improper or misleading, please send an email 
      
      to themiddleman@gmail.com
      
      User Content
      For purposes of these Terms, (a) “Content” 
      
      means all text, images, photos, audio, video, 
      
      graphics, reviews, location data, and all 
      
      other forms of data, communication, or media, 
      
      (b) “User Content” means Content that users 
      
      submit or transmit to, through, or in 
      
      connection with the Websites or Services, 
      
      such as ratings, reviews, orders, favorites, 
      
      photos, videos, media, messages, social media 
      
      posts or Services, comments, and information 
      
      that such user publicly displays or displayed 
      
      in its User Profile, and including any 
      
      electronic data or information with respect 
      
      to a User’s customers, (c) “TheMiddleMan 
      
      Content” means Content that we create or is 
      
      otherwise owned by us that we make available 
      
      in connection with the Websites or Services, 
      
      (d) “Third Party Content” means Content that 
      
      originates from parties other than 
      
      TheMiddleMan or users of any of the Websites 
      
      or Services, which is made available in 
      
      connection with the Websites or Services and 
      
      not otherwise owned by us, and (e) “Website 
      
      Content” means all of the Content that is 
      
      made available in connection with the 
      
      Websites or Services, including User Content, 
      
      Third Party Content (and Third Party Material 
      
      (as defined below)), and TheMiddleMan 
      
      Content.
      
      By submitting User Content, you represent, 
      
      warrant, and covenant:
      That you own, or have the necessary licenses, 
      
      rights, consents, and/or permissions, and 
      
      authorize TheMiddleMan, its applicable 
      
      affiliates, the Websites, the Services, and 
      
      all users thereof, to use such User Content 
      
      as necessary to exercise the licenses granted 
      
      by you hereunder (including with respect to 
      
      all patent, trademark, trade secret, 
      
      copyright, or other intellectual property or 
      
      proprietary rights to your User Content, and 
      
      to any other works that you incorporate into 
      
      your User Content);
      That you are entirely responsible for 
      
      anything you submit to the Websites or 
      
      Services and agree that TheMiddleMan does not 
      
      have to post or keep posted anything you 
      
      provide. Once posted on the Websites or on 
      
      the Internet, it is not always possible to 
      
      remove, especially if multiple copies exist. 
      
      When User Content is uploaded to the Websites 
      
      or Services, or posted on any social media 
      
      platforms with a tag or reference to 
      
      Weedmaps, you give TheMiddleMan complete 
      
      permission to make it available in multiple 
      
      forms, including, without limitation, on any 
      
      of our social media accounts, email 
      
      newsletters, or any digital or print 
      
      promotional materials. If any of your User 
      
      Content is acquired and used by a third party 
      
      in a way that violates these Terms, any 
      
      Additional Terms, or the Privacy Policy, you 
      
      agree that TheMiddleMan can take legal action 
      
      against the third party and that TheMiddleMan 
      
      shall not be obligated to distribute any

      Delivery and Pick-Up Orders
      TheMiddleMan may provide users with the 
      
      ability to transmit orders for cannabis-
      
      related products and arrange for delivery or 
      
      pick-up of such products through third-party, 
      
      unaffiliated vendors (“MM Orders”). MM Orders 
      
      is a third-party online marketplace platform 
      
      for customers (“Customers”) to transmit such 
      
      orders with participating vendors (the 
      
      “Retailers”). MM Orders provides order 
      
      transmission services only and serves purely 
      
      as a communications medium. MM Orders is not 
      
      a merchant of cannabis-related products, or 
      
      provider of any pick-up or delivery services 
      
      in connection therewith, and does not control 
      
      the Retailers or the production of any 
      
      cannabis-related products, or any pick-up or 
      
      delivery services in connection therewith.
      
      The Retailers have entered into agreements 
      
      with TheMiddleMan or its applicable affiliate 
      
      where they have made representations that 
      
      they currently are compliant with applicable 
      
      law and will comply with applicable law in 
      
      their use of MM Orders. TheMiddleMan and its 
      
      affiliates do not in any way independently 
      
      verify the credentials or representations of 
      
      any of the Retailers, the authenticity or 
      
      quality of any of their products or services, 
      
      or any Retailer’s compliance with applicable 
      
      law.
      
      Customers using MM Orders must make 
      
      themselves comfortable through the 
      
      information provided by the Retailers on the 
      
      Websites, by contacting the Retailers 
      
      directly, or through such other means or 
      
      methods as they may deem appropriate, as to 
      
      the quality and reliability of the Retailers 
      
      and the Retailers’ compliance with applicable 
      
      law. TheMiddleMan, including the Websites and 
      
      the Services, do not in any way guarantee the 
      
      quality of any Retailer or any cannabis-
      
      related product, or any pick-up or delivery 
      
      service in connection therewith, or any 
      
      Retailer’s compliance thereof with applicable 
      
      law. In addition, a Retailer may represent 
      
      certain standards with respect to their 
      
      cannabis products (or other services), such 
      
      as labeling such products as “organic”, 
      
      “pesticide-free”, achieving a certain potency 
      
      level, undergoing certain testing procedures, 
      
      fungus levels, containing specific terpene or 
      
      cannabinoid profile or contents (including 
      
      THC or CBD levels), having certain medicinal 
      
      or other effects, or otherwise. TheMiddleMan 
      
      and its affiliates do not investigate or 
      
      verify any such statements. Furthermore, any 
      
      such statements have not been evaluated by 
      
      the Food and Drug Administration. 
      
      TheMiddleMan and its applicable affiliates 
      
      make no claims meant to diagnose, treat, or 
      
      cure any disease or medical condition. 
      
      Customers should consult their doctor before 
      
      starting any treatment or using any 
      
      cannabis-related product during pregnancy or 
      
      if they have a serious medical condition. 
      
      TheMiddleMan and its affiliates shall not be 
      
      liable or responsible for any cannabis-
      
      related products, or any other services, 
      
      offered by the Retailers or any errors or 
      
      misrepresentations made by them (including on 
      
      the Websites and through MM Orders or other 
      
      Services).
      
      User Representations, Warranties, and 
      
      Covenants Regarding Orders
      By using MM Orders, you represent, warrant 
      
      and covenant that: (1) you will upload and 
      
      maintain in your User Profile a valid, 
      
      unexpired government-issued identification 
      
      card and, if you will be ordering medical 
      
      cannabis, a recommendation for medical 
      
      cannabis that is valid in the applicable 
      
      jurisdiction in which you place an order via 
      
      MM Orders, and that (2) your use of the 
      
      Websites and the Services, including MM 
      
      Orders, does not violate any applicable state 
      
      or local law, including any legal 
      
      requirements for orders you place through MM 
      
      Orders. Upon delivery or pick-up, as 
      
      applicable, you agree to present a 
      
      government-issued identification card 
      
      evidencing your age as well as your original 
      
      recommendation if you order cannabis. If you 
      
      do not comply with these terms regarding MM 
      
      Orders, you agree that cannabis products may 
      
      not be released to you by the applicable 
      
      Retailer, and you may forfeit the cost of 
      
      such products.
      
      Employee Participation in Orders
      Employees of TheMiddleMan or any of its 
      
      affiliates are permitted to use the Websites 
      
      and the Services in their personal capacity

      affiliates) in the transactions conducted

      their personal capacity, are subject to the 
      
      same procedures and guidelines contained in 
      
      the Terms, Additional Terms, or Privacy 
      
      Policy as any buyer or seller on the 
      
      applicable Website.

      TheMiddleMan does not assume and will not 
      
      have any liability or responsibility to you

      links thereto are provided solely as a 
      
      convenience to you and you access and use 
      
      them entirely at your own risk. When you link

      third-party’s terms and policies apply, 
      
      including the third-party’s privacy and data 
      
      gathering practices. You should make whatever 
      
      investigation you feel necessary or 
      
      appropriate before proceeding with any 
      
      transaction in connection with such Third-
      
      Party Material.
      
      The Website or Services might display, 
      
      include, or make available coupons, 
      
      promotional codes, giveaways, samples, and 
      
      other offers from listed dispensaries or

      displays these Offers on the Website and 
      
      Services as a form of advertisement for the

      by the applicable Offeror, and may be subject 
      
      to additional terms, conditions, or

      limitation, the advertisement, redemption, 
      
      and terms, conditions, and restrictions 
      
      related thereto); (c) all goods and services 
      
      it provides to you in connection with the 
      
      Offer; and (d) all injuries, illnesses, 
      
      damages, claims, liabilities, and costs it 
      
      may cause you to suffer, directly or 
      
      indirectly, in full or in part, whether 
      
      related to the use or redemption of an Offer

      You agree not to settle any matter without 
      
      the prior written consent of TheMiddleMan. 
      
      TheMiddleMan will use reasonable efforts to 
      
      notify you of any such claim, action, or 
      
      proceeding upon becoming aware of it.
      
      If there is a dispute between users of the 
      
      Websites or Services, including between 
      
      Customers and Retailers (each, a “Dispute”), 
      
      you understand and agree that TheMiddleMan 
      
      and its affiliates (including the Websites 
      
      and the Services, including MM Orders) are 
      
      under no obligation to become involved in 
      
      such Dispute.
      
      You hereby release and forever discharge 
      
      TheMiddleMan (and its owners, directors, 
      
      managers, officers, partners, employees, 
      
      independent contractors, and agents, and 
      
      successors and assigns of itself or its 
      
      affiliates) from, and hereby waive and 
      
      relinquish your rights with respect to, each 
      
      and every past, present, and future dispute, 
      
      claim, controversy, demand, right, 
      
      obligation, liability, action, and cause of 
      
      action of every kind and nature (including 
      
      personal injuries, death, and property 
      
      damage), that has arisen or arises directly 
      
      or indirectly out of, or relates directly or 
      
      indirectly to, any interactions with, or act 
      
      or omission of, other Websites or Services or 
      
      Third-Party Materials. For the avoidance of 
      
      doubt, this release includes a release of any 
      
      dispute, claim, controversy, demand, right, 
      
      obligation, liability, action, and cause of

      to a Dispute, regardless of whether such 
      
      dispute, claim, controversy, demand, right, 
      
      obligation, liability, action, and cause of 
      
      action are known or unknown, suspected or

      are a California resident or resident of a 
      
      state with a similar applicable law, you 
      
      hereby waive California Civil Code section 
      
      1542 in connection with the foregoing (or 
      
      such other similar applicable law in your 
      
      state), which states: “a general release does 
      
      not extend to claims which the creditor does 
      
      not know or suspect to exist in his or her 
      
      favor at the time of executing the release, 
      
      which if known by him or her must have 
      
      materially affected his or her settlement 
      
      with the debtor.” <br></br>

      12. Review/Feedback Policy
      An important part of the TheMiddleMan 
      
      community is the feedback system. Users have 
      
      the ability to leave reviews and comments, 
      
      and we want that process to be as open as 
      
      possible. Part of that openness is 
      
      acknowledging that certain behaviors are not 
      
      acceptable. TheMiddleMan retains the right to 
      
      remove any content posted on or submitted 
      
      through any of its Websites or Services. 
      
      However, the only User Content likely to be 
      
      removed is that which violates these Terms, 
      
      any Additional Terms, or the Privacy Policy, 
      
      or the rules or guidelines on the applicable 
      
      Website or Service regarding reviews, 
      
      comments, feedbacks and other User Content 
      
      (the “Review Policies”). Please note, the 
      
      Review Policies of each Website or Service 
      
      may differ. Please consult the relevant 
      
      Website or Service to learn about its 
      
      applicable Review Policy.
      
      Please note, TheMiddleMan is under no 
      
      obligation to enforce these Terms, any 
      
      Additional Terms, or the Privacy Policy or 
      
      any of the Review Policies on your behalf 
      
      against another user. While TheMiddleMan 
      
      encourages you to let us know if you believe 
      
      another user has violated these Terms, any 
      
      Additional Terms, or the Privacy Policy, or 
      
      any of the Review Policies, we reserve the 
      
      right to investigate and take appropriate 
      
      action at our sole discretion. <br></br>

      The laws of the state of California, 
      
      excluding California’s conflict of laws 
      
      rules, will apply to any disputes arising out 
      
      of or relating to these Terms or any of the 
      
      Websites or Services. All claims arising out 
      
      of or relating to these Terms or any of the 
      
      Websites or Services will be litigated 
      
      exclusively in the federal or state courts of

      The failure of TheMiddleMan to enforce any 
      
      right or provision of these Terms will not

      that right or provision. The waiver of any 
      
      such right or provision will be effective 
      
      only if in writing and signed by a duly

      remedies under these Terms will be without 
      
      prejudice to its other remedies under these 
      
      Terms or otherwise. If for any reason a court 
      
      of competent jurisdiction finds any provision 
      
      of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that 
      
      provision will be enforced to the maximum 
      
      extent permissible and the other provisions 
      
      of these Terms will remain in full force and

      These Terms do not and are not intended to 
      
      confer any rights or remedies upon any person 
      
      other than you and TheMiddleMan. <br></br>

      If any of the conditions contained within 
      
      these Terms shall be deemed invalid, void, or
