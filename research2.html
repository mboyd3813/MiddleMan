    <p class="lead">Recreational cannabis is the form of cannabis that people use to get ‘high’ and
        Medical marijuana is the medical use of the Cannabis sativa or Cannabis indica plant.
        The term medical marijuana refers to using the whole, unprocessed marijuana plant or its basic extracts to treat symptoms of illness and other conditions. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not recognized or approved the marijuana plant as medicine.  However, some states and the District of Columbia allow its use for certain health purposes. Whether marijuana has therapeutic benefits that outweigh its health risks is still uncertain.
